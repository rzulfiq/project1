      <h2>Healthcare Training Simulation using VR:</h2>
      <p>Context: Hospitals and medical institutions utilize VR simulations for training purposes.<br>
      Details: Surgeons and medical students can practice surgeries in a controlled, risk-free environment, improving skills and decision-making. Using VR simulations ensures that students do not practice on live patients, respecting ethical considerations related to the patient's health and well-being. In addition, VR also creates diverse scenarios, allowing students to be exposed to a wide range of medical conditions, emergencies, and procedures. Challenges include ensuring accurate and realistic simulations and the high initial cost of VR equipment.</p>

      <h2>Retail AR Applications:</h2>
      <p>Context: Retailers integrate AR into their platforms to enhance customer experiences.<br>
      Details: AR-enabled apps allow users to visualize products like furniture in their homes before purchasing. AR also allows customers to virtually try on products, such as clothes, shoes, and accessories without physically being at the store. This feature helps in visualizing how products will look like so that they can make better purchasing decisions. Challenges include the need for high-quality 3D models and seamless integration to ensure the accuracy and realism of the AR experiences. Needs to update the content regularly to reflect inventory changes and seasonal offerings.</p>

      <h2>Education AR Classroom:</h2>
      <p>Context: Classrooms use apps to create interactive experiences.<br>
      Details: AR used in education with platforms like Google Expedition and Wonderscope. These platforms offer students virtual field trips and immersive learning experiences. Challenges include the cost of providing AR-compatible devices for every student and teacher training to effectively integrate AR apps into lesson plans.</p>
